# Visualization Techniques in Python
The main idea of this repository is present all most poular visualization in python. the repo is divided into 5 segments that refer to what exactly we want to present.

# Content of repo:
### Distribution:
- Histogram
- Density plot
- Stacked histogram
- Stacked density plot
- Overlapping histograms
- Overlapping density plots
- Ridge plot

- Violin plot
- Strip plot

### Connections:
- Scatter plot
- Bubble plot

- 2D line plot and time series
- Principal Components analysis

### Quantity:
- Bar chart
